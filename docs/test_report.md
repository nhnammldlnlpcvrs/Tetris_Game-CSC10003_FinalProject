## Detailed Results

### ✅ Test Rotate
All blocks (I, J, L, O, S, T, Z) were tested for:
- Initial cell positions
- Positions after `Rotate()`
- Positions after `UndoRotation()`

The `OBlock` was confirmed to remain unchanged after rotation, as expected.

Total assertions: **25**  
All passed.

---

### ✅ Test Grid
A 20x10 grid was printed and verified to be initialized with all cells set to `0`, representing an empty state.

Total assertions: **200**  
All passed.

---

## Conclusion
All unit tests have passed successfully. The current implementation of blocks and grid logic meets the expected functionality and integrity standards.
